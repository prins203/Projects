<h4><center><p>The Magic of Guerlain: In the world of fragrance and beauty, The House of Guerlain has a reputation of unparalleled devotion to luxury, sophistication and <br>elegance. The spirit of discovery, handed down from generation to generation, complements Guerlain’s dedication to beauty. In 1939, Guerlain opened its<br> first “Institut de Beauté” and invented an exclusive facial massage technique. Perfected over time, all the Guerlain facial massage techniques remain just as <br>unique and exclusive today. Fittingly, Guerlain Spa massage therapists are each trained in the manner of Guerlain ~ in Paris.</p>

<p>In 1939, Guerlain created one of the first “Spas” in the world at 68, avenue des Champs-Elysées. It was during this period that the Guerlain massage<br> method was born, which remains unique and exclusive today. It has been enriched with numerous exclusive treatment protocols, all with the aim of <br>offering the best of beauty expertise and optimal effectiveness. The very essence of the Guerlain experience is to transform your beauty treatment into an <br>event created for you and you alone – a real alchemy between our know-how and our beauty expertise.</p>

<p>Even years later, The House of Guerlain continues this tradition of firsts. Releasing Terracotta, the benchmark for all bronzers, and Meteorites, the first<br> product to incorporate colored pearls to create luminosity and even out skin tone, Guerlain pushes innovation and pursues perfection without end. These <br>unparalleled beauty lines combined with more than 700 fragrances – several of which are considered to be among the masterpieces of perfumery – create<br> a name that has become internationally recognized as a symbol of artistry, quality, style, and grace.</p>
